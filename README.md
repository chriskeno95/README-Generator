# README-Generator

This repo holds the relevant files needed for my professional README generator

## Description

Using the node environment/node.js I have created a professional readme generator that prompts the user withquestions such as their Github name, does their project have a licence, and if the project has any installation,usage, testing and contributing instructions.

You can view the generated README file this this repo - it contains all the needed informtion about this project and has been producted by the prompts/ questions asked in the CLI (command line interface).
