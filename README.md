# README-Generator

This repo holds the relevant files needed for my professional README generator

## Description

Using the node environment/node.js I have created a professional readme generator that prompts the user withquestions such as their Github name, does their project have a licence, and if the project has any installation,usage, testing and contributing instructions.

You can view the generated README file this this repo [here](https://github.com/chriskeno95/README-Generator/blob/main/README_Template.md) - it contains all the needed informtion about this project and has been producted by the prompts/ questions asked in the CLI (command line interface).

I was unable to screen-record this project so i have added screenshots of the terminal as it ptinted the prompts and the answers it then stored as data so that the data could then be used to populate the generated README file.

I used the speedruns provided to help me with the question prompts.
